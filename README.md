## Digital Clock in Python

This Python script implements a simple digital clock that displays the current time in a 24-hour format. The script uses the `tkinter` library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) window to display the clock.

## Features:
- Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Updates the displayed time every second to reflect the current time accurately.
- Uses the `tkinter` library for creating the GUI window and displaying the clock.
- Includes a function (`update_time()`) to update the displayed time by fetching the current system time.
- The script utilizes a recursive method (`update_time()`) to continuously update the displayed time every second.

## Usage:
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Execute the script by running `python digital_clock.py` in the terminal or command prompt.
3. A GUI window will open displaying the current time.
4. The displayed time will update automatically every second.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (usually included in standard Python installations)

## Note: This script is a basic example of a digital clock using `tkinter` and demonstrates how to create a simple GUI application in Python for displaying real-time information.
